## Skill Architecture

Each skill follows a consistent three-layer architecture:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md                        # Main file: Trigger conditions, workflow, core guidance
├── LICENSE.txt                     # Apache 2.0 license
└── references/
    ├── xxx-methodology.md          # Detailed methodology: Formulas, scoring criteria, industry benchmarks
    └── output-template.md          # Report template: Structured output format
```

### Progressive Disclosure Design

- **Always in context**: Only the YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) from `SKILL.md` is used for trigger detection
- **Loaded on trigger**: The `SKILL.md` body — workflow and core guidance
- **Loaded on demand**: Files in `references/` directory — detailed methodologies and templates loaded only when executing analysis

This design optimizes context window usage while providing complete analytical frameworks when needed.

## Market-Specific Design

China-market skills are not simple translations of US-market versions. They are comprehensively rewritten to address A-share market characteristics:

| Dimension | US-market | China-market |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Language** | English | Chinese |
| **Market Structure** | NYSE/NASDAQ, SEC regulation | SSE/SZSE/Beijing Stock Exchange, CSRC regulation |
| **Industry Classification** | GICS | Shenwan Industry Classification |
| **Insider Trading** | SEC Form 4 filings | Director/executive/shareholder trading announcements |
| **Dividends** | Quarterly dividends, Dividend Aristocrats | Annual dividends, CSI Dividend Index |
| **Tax System** | Capital gains tax, dividend tax | No capital gains tax, dividend tax tied to holding period |
| **Valuation Characteristics** | Mature market valuation levels | A-share premium, policy premium, shell value (declining) |
| **Policy Impact** | Fed policy, SEC regulation | State Council, PBOC, CSRC, industrial policy (extremely high weight) |
| **Capital Structure** | Institution-dominated | High retail trading share, northbound capital marginal impact |
| **Investment Tools** | ETFs, Options, REITs | ETFs, Convertible bonds, Public REITs, QDII |
